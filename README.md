**Finding the best set-up is hard**, especially when there's new tools what feels like every day. Design Toolbox **eliminates decision fatigue** by only listing **recommended tools.**<br>

## ðŸ§° How it works

Each recommended toolkit is named for a workstream, such as UX, Front-End, etc. Find the right [kit](#kits) for your stream, scan through the tools and grab whichever you need. Other useful lists and utilities can be found in the [bins](#bins).

Tools are judged on the following rules of thumb. The rules leave room for an *opinion on which is best*, so that you don't have to spend as much time evaluating each tool. In principle, if you agree with the rules, you can trust the list.

<br>

<pre align="center">
<h3>Rules of thumb</h3>
Universal > Mac/iOS > Other

Native > Web

Open Source > Proprietary

Free > Paid > Subscription

Open File Formats > File Portability > Vendor Lock-In

Established > Challenger > Beta

For any size team > For big teams > For small teams

Fewer tools > More tools

</pre>

<br>

A full list of [all tools](#tool-list) can be found after the toolboxes. The full list contains more information on each tool, including any killer features, dealbreakers and a link to the source.

If you have a suggestion, correction, the list is out of date or you think the recommendation is plain wrong, you can [raise an issue](/issues).

## ðŸ§° Contributing

All tools need sharpening once in a while, so contribution is welcome. If you just want to make a suggestion or correction, raising an [issue](/issues) is the way to go. If you're comfortable with Github you can also open a pull request to suggest a change.
